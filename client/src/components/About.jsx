        <p>
          I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for learning and
          problem-solving. I discovered my love and passion for coding during my Master's program.
          My focus is on JavaScript and its frameworks, but I am always looking to learn new technologies.
          I am excited to bring my unique perspective to a team of talented developers.
