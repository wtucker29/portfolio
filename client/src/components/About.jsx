        <p className="about-paragraph">
          I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for learning and problem-solving. I discovered my love and passion for coding while taking computer science classes during my Master's program. My time coding while working on machine learning projects was the spark that ignited my passion for coding and lead me on the path to becoming a software engineer.
          My focus is on JavaScript and its frameworks, but I am always looking to learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          Previously, I worked as a mechanical engineer for over 8 years where I developed my problem-solving skills, as well as my leadership and communication abilities. I have lead multi-national and cross-functional teams during my previous career, as well as being an individual contributor.
          I am excited to bring my unique perspective to a team of talented developers.
