        Previously, I worked as a mechanical engineer for over 8 years where I developed my problem-solving skills, as well as my leadership and communication abilities. I have lead multi-national and cross-functional teams during my previous career, as well as being an individual contributor.
        I am excited to bring my unique perspective to a team of talented developers.
